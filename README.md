## Introduction
Wordle is a word game similar to the TV show [Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(British_game_show)).

You get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter target word. After each guess, the letters light up in various colors as clues. Green means a letter is correct in this spot; yellow means a letter is _elsewhere_ in the target word; gray means a letter is not in the target word at all.

## History
In 2021, Josh "powerlanguage" Wardle created _Wordle_, a version of the Lingo word game that you can play once a day. The target word is the same for everyone each day, and you can share results to Twitter and compare with your friends. This made Wordle [go absolutely viral](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) around January 2022.

lynn liked this game a lot, but wanted to play more than once a day, so she created her own version of it, where the words are random but you can play as much as you like. She called it _hello wordl_, which is a sort of [bad programming joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program).

I saw people were using pencil and paper to make their own Wordles for others to play, so I decided to make this work online with DIY Wordle. Frozen B.A. helped me make it work!

## But playing once a day is the point!
Don't get me wrong: we all think this is the most brilliant aspect of Wordle, and we don't aim to dethrone or improve on the "real" game.

## My word contained two of the same letter!
This can happen in Wordle too, and we give clues exactly the same way Wordle does. I think the game would be too easy if we got rid of double letters, so we won't.
